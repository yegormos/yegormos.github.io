Project Name: Tea Moves (30MFF WEB SITE)

Project Description: The aim of the project is to create a website that is revolved around the 30MFF video that we filmed during our first class. While designing the website to fit the theme of tea making I used some CSS and JS properties to strengthen the design of my website for user attention and also to display what I've learned. 

The overall concept is the tea making process as well as an attempt to involve the user with the tea making process by getting them to do the challenge. I've picked a nice Futura font that reflects the relaxation a cup of tea can provide.

The experience is trying to best describe the relaxation and harmony that tea brings as well as some JS features to keep the users attention and show my skills. Then with large blocks of text I tried to higlight and bold the most important and condensed version of that paragpraph for faster comprehension.

Process: I visited many websites that sell tea and observed the kind of fonts and colors that they use and imitated them in my own way to create the experience around the video and extending beyond it to engage the viewers. I tried to keep more easy going with some attempted jokes and emojis. Which I think reflects the mood of the video quite well. 

Reflection/Evaluation: I think that my final project is significantly different from my original wireframe. At first I thought of creating a movie experience where I will display made up reviews by critics about it which will conclude in the link to the movie. But I quickly realized that making those reviews interactive would be very difficult for me at the current stage, therefore, the end result wouldn't be what I've imagined. 
Then, I went back to square one and thought that the video should be one of the first things the user is exposed to for greater likelihood of the user actually watching the video. I also thought it would be good to visit some websites that markets themselves as tea shops, which would give me an idea for the range of experiences that I can create for my website. Then implementing some of the fonts, desings and colors I started building my own website called Tea Moves. I think it is a catchy name that is reflective of our filming as well as moves is quite close to movies. 
Another big part of my the website construction was making sure that the website doesn't fall apart if someone minizes the web page. This was probably the problems that took me the most time to solve or the most time to wait for someone to help me to solve it.
If I had a little bit more time on my hands I would like to incorporate an 'About us' page that would have a similar layout and would have a box with four squares of qual size inside. This would mimic the zoom video page that is at the beginning of the video, then some clip art of all the members in the video would be placed in their respectvie zoom boxes as in the video. This way I would be able to introduce the members of the video and have the user remember them.

To conclude, I am very happy with my final version. I think it ended up being better than I expected. I am especailly happy with my recipe page as those images and JS took me ages to figure out.
